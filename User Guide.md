Now search the product name in the search line. If the product doesn't appear, you'll need to add it.

In my example it looks like:

It'll open the product activity.

## Search for recos:
In my example I'd like to look for a vacuum cleaner reco.
First of all, I pressed on the "Electronics" category on the categories activity.
Then I texted "va" on the search view.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/HavahGerhardt/RecoShop/blob/master/screenshots/Search%20product%20.png" width="250" >
</p>
I pressed at the first (and only) result that I got.
It opened the product activity:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/HavahGerhardt/RecoShop/blob/master/screenshots/Product%202recos.png" width="400" >
</p>

I pressed at the best reco, which has one like (the user1's reco). It opened the reco activity:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/HavahGerhardt/RecoShop/blob/master/screenshots/Reco%20activity%20like1.png" width="400" >
</p>
Then I could add a like (by clicking on the "Add Like" button) and open the shopping site.
